### Tutorials and Examples provided in Jupyter Notebooks (.NET kernel) and Codespaces.

## Instructions
* To access the Jupyter Notebook in your browser:
  * Click on the binder link above and wait for the environment to build
* You can interact with the code
* You can run each code block by pressing `ctrl+enter`,
* or using the links within the Jupyter Lab - Interactive Python Notebook (.ipynb)
* Even though the file name indicates **Python**, the environment kernel we are using is .NET
  * Therefore, we can edit, build, and run C# source code
